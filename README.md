# Coding Quiz

There are total 10 files that I made.

These 10 files are made up with 
- HTML (1.index.html/ 2.game.html/ 3. end.html/ 4.highscores.html) in order
- CSS (1. style.CSS (connected with 'index.html' 'end.html') / 2. game.CSS / 3.highscores.CSS) in order
- JavaScript (1.game.js/ 2.end.js /3.highscores.js) in order.



# Caution

- This quiz is intended to compete with users, only 'highscores' are able to put into their name at the Ending page
(you score must beat previous highscore users)

it turns to be black.
